# Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, Release #128 (2018.11)

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I‚Äôm very happy to announce the
November 2018 release of Rakudo Perl¬†6 #128. Rakudo is an implementation of
Perl¬†6 on the Moar Virtual Machine[^1].

This release implements 6.c and 6.d versions of the Perl¬†6 specification.
6.c version of the language is available if you use the `use v6.c`
version pragma, otherwise 6.d is the default.

Upcoming releases in 2018 will include new functionality that is not
part of 6.c or 6.d specifications, available with a lexically scoped
pragma. Our goal is to ensure that anything that is tested as part of
6.c and 6.d specifications will continue to work unchanged. There may
be incremental spec releases this year as well.

The tarball for this release is available from <https://rakudo.org/files/rakudo>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star
distribution[^2] ‚Äî it‚Äôs announcing a new release of the compiler
only. For the latest Rakudo Star release, see
<https://rakudo.org/files/star>.

The changes in this release are outlined below:

[^2]: What‚Äôs the difference between the Rakudo compiler and the Rakudo
Star distribution?

The Rakudo compiler is a compiler for the Perl¬†6 language.
Not much more.

The Rakudo Star distribution is the Rakudo compiler plus a selection
of useful Perl¬†6 modules, a module installer, Perl¬†6 introductory
documentation, and other software that can be used with the Rakudo
compiler to enhance its utility.
